# Event-driven Chat Server
 
## Description

  This is an event-driven chat server whose function is to forward each incoming message to all clients connected,
  except for the client connection over which the message was received.
  
## Usage

  Command line usage: server <port>
  **<Port>** is the port number the server will listen on. The port should be in the range of 1 to (2^16) i.e 1 to 65536

Requirements
------------

  You need GCC installed to run the server.

Quick start
-----------

    $ gcc chatServer.c  -o server
    $ ./server 8080 

## Options

	8080 - the port the server will listen on.


## How does it work?

   The server runs and uses select() in a loop to check for the socket that is ready for reading or writing.
   If the socket is not the listening socket, it checks to see if the socket is ready for reading. If it is ready,
   it reads from the socket and then forward the message to all other connected socket or client except the one which
   the message was received from.
